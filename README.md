# dreamy-cabin-frontend
It's a company internal level application where the target audience are company employees. Frontend will be built with react-stack, remote fetching will be done using react queries,  UI related state will be handle with context API &amp; useState hook ( UI state is simplar than remote state), styling will be handle with style-component.
